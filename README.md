📌 Project Description
The Food Delivery App is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This project allows users to explore various food items, add them to their cart, place orders, and apply a special coupon code ("RAGHAVC04") to get a discount.

The application provides secure authentication using JWT, a responsive user interface, and an intuitive ordering process. It also integrates MongoDB as the database to store user information, orders, and food items.

This project is ideal for learning and implementing full-stack web development concepts, including React.js for frontend, Node.js & Express.js for backend APIs, and MongoDB for data storage.
